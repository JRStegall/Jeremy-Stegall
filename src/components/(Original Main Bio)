            I am a life long musician and performer who thrives in collaborative
            environments that challenge my intellect and creativity.
            &nbsp;Looking for flexible career paths that incorporate both, I
            discovered web design & development and began teaching myself HTML,
            CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript. &nbsp;I then decided to further my
            education by attending DigitalCrafts Full-Stack software development
            program. &nbsp;I am currently a GDOT constrcution project manager.

            Aside from the lucrative and near-limitless career prospects that
            the tech world has to offer, my main goal is to continue to learn
            and grow as I evolve into a well rounded full-stack developer while
            maintaining a healthy work/life balance.

            In the past, computer programming and web design &amp; development
            were not possible career paths for anyone without a 4 year degree in
            graphic design or computer science, however; With the ever growing
            need for competent full-stack engineers, and with the advent of
            online tutorials and coding bootcamps, I began to see breaking into
            this ever growing industry to be more attainable.
